				<description>&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;
Firt piece on conspiracies. You can find it &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13608746.2017.1359894?scroll=top&amp;amp;needAccess=true&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;
Beliefs in conspiracy theories have attracted significant international media attention in recent years. This phenomenon has been studied in the US but while anecdotal evidence suggests it is also widespread among the Italian public, little evidence has been collected to assess it empirically. Using data from a 2016 survey, this pioneering study of the Italian case investigates the extent of diffusion of conspiracy theories among Italians and tests several hypotheses concerning individual determinants. The paper finds that conspiracism is indeed widely diffused in Italy. It is negatively associated with education and positively with religiosity, while no correlation is found with political trust. Beliefs in conspiracies are also related to rightwing orientation and support for the populist Five Star Movement.

&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Mechanisms that are known to forge political agreement include interpersonal
influence—the process by which people change their ideas according to others’
attitudes—and selection—people’s choice of their discussants according to their
discussants’ preferences. Using data obtained from a longitudinal survey, we test how
these two processes contribute to changing vote choices or discussants around the 2014
European elections in Italy. Results partly confirm findings from the previous literature,
showing influence and selection effects. Moreover, it is suggested that the family
contributes crucially in stimulating strategies that result in political agreement.
Propensities to maintain agreeable discussants over time and to change voting choice
are boosted by exposure to family members.
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

				<title>New article on "Political Psychology"</title>
				<description>&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;
So proud of this one. You can find it &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pops.12400/abstract&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;
Recently, the social sciences have witnessed a rising interest in dyadic design, as an efficient way to disentangle mechanisms of interpersonal influence. Despite the relevance of this design to political research, few efforts have been made to collect and efficiently analyze dyadic data. In this article, we suggest the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model as a useful tool to test bidirectional effects in dyadic data on political attitudes and behaviors. The model explicitly assumes that members of a dyad (reciprocally identified as actor and partner) involved in political communication are interdependent and influence each other. We apply the model to estimate the effect of partner's party identification on actor's vote choice, using 1996 Indianapolis–St. Louis dyadic data. Results show that partner's party identification is significantly associated with vote choice. Moreover, we show that influence between dyad members is moderated by their intimacy and that an increased difference in socioeconomic status between dyad members tips the balance of the effect in favor of the individual with more resources. Our conclusions point to the effectiveness of APIM in modeling interdependent asymmetric relations and call for increasing efforts in collecting dyadic data and in developing proper tools for their analysis.&lt;/i&gt;

				<title>New article on "Territory, Politics, Governance"</title>
				<description>&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;
You can find it &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21622671.2016.1265462&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;br /&gt;
And here's the abstract: &lt;i&gt;Local and national effects in the electoral cycle: the case of Italy, 2001–2009. Territory, Politics, Governance. According to electoral cycle theory, in second-order elections small parties are expected to improve their performance, while big parties are expected to be punished. This paper formally tests whether these electoral cycle effects can be considered as solely national in nature or whether they vary at the local level. It tests the expectations in Northern Italy in two electoral cycles (2001–2004 and 2008–2009), with special reference to Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia/PdL and the smaller ally, Lega Nord. The paper analyses electoral outcomes at the municipality level with spatial analysis techniques (Moran’s I and spatial autoregressive model), showing that parties’ support seems to follow a local electoral cycle, partly independent from the aggregate one.&lt;/i&gt;

				<title>Article on "European Journal of Population" is now out on paper</title>
				<description>&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;
Very proud of this one. You can find it &lt;a href=&quot;http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10680-016-9380-6&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;br /&gt;
And here's the abstract: &lt;i&gt; Drawing on seminal work by Nazio and Blossfeld (Eur J Popul 19(1):47–82, 2003) and Di Giulio and Rosina (Demogr Res 16(14):441–468, 2007), this paper tests whether the recent spread of cohabitation in Italy has followed the typical pattern of diffusion of innovation processes. In doing so, we contribute to the debate on the determinants of the emergence of “new” family behaviour. Following previous literature, innovative behaviour should spread initially through direct social modelling, i.e. interpersonal communication among highly selected individuals (peer effects). At later stages, the diffusion should spread through knowledge awareness of the innovation, i.e. communication with previous generations (pre-cohort effects), so that also less selected individuals are prone to adopt the new behaviour. In the specific Italian context—a Catholic, “familistic” setting, with high normative pressure and importance of parental approval—we surmise the influence of previous generations to be dominant. We use data from the “Family and Social Subjects” survey carried out by Istat (2009) and apply Event History Analysis in the form of competing-risks exponential models to study Italian women’s transition to cohabitation as first partnership. Results suggest that the most important driver of the spreading of cohabitation in Italy is represented by the degree of its diffusion among older cohorts. However, we find a positive and significant interaction between women’s education and peer effects at the onset of the phenomenon, in line with the Second Demographic Transition (SDT) hypothesis. Cohabitation is also more likely if parents experienced separation/divorce and, more generally, if the environment of the family of origin can be described as “SDT-friendly”.&lt;/i&gt;

				<title>Article on "RISP (Italian Political Science Review)" is now out on paper</title>
				<description>&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;
My article &quot;Contexts, networks, and voting behavior: the social flow of political communication in Italy&quot; is out now on RISP - Italian Political Science Review. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Here's the abstract: &lt;i&gt;Previous research demonstrated that different contextual sources can affect voting behavior. Homogeneous familiar networks affect individual behavior of people embedded in these networks toward voting for certain parties. Moreover, being exposed to higher levels of homogeneity in the geographical place where one lives contributes to developing higher propensities to vote for a certain political object. By means of 2006 National Italian Elections data (and by employing new measures of network political homogeneity), this paper tests, with multilevel models, the hypothesis according to which networks and geographical context interact while affecting individuals’ voting behavior. Results confirm such a hypothesis, showing that familiar networks represent a ‘social bubble’, which limits the likelihood of being affected by the broader context.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Apparently it's freely downloadable &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/italian-political-science-review-rivista-italiana-di-scienza-politica/article/div-classtitlecontexts-networks-and-voting-behavior-the-social-flow-of-political-communication-in-italydiv/3BF41EC9B63378569F3403450B6D9236&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (don't know for how long).

				<title>New working paper (Collegio Carlo Alberto Notebooks)</title>
				<description>&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;
A new working paper has been published in the Collegio Carlo Alberto Notebooks series (No. 464). 
The paper argues that, to understand the impressive performances of some parties in relative small periods of time, 
we can employ the diffusion of innovation theoretical framework. A lot of math and nice agent-based simulations are included.

				<title>Working paper and presentation at SISP conference</title>
				<description>&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;
During the XXX SISP conference in Milan (September 14-16, 2016) I have presented a (very, very) early stage paper concerning selective exposure to populist appeals in social media. The article is available &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sisp.it/docs/convegno2016/125_sisp2016_comunicazione-politica.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;

				<title>New website</title>
				<description>&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;
Ok, that's pretty embarrassing, but I'm all grown up, I started publishing something, and I must launch my brand-new personal website. After about a half-hour-long beta-testing on it, I concluded that it's more or less readable on Chrome/Ubuntu. Having played quite a bit with the (terrific) &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dbtek&quot;&gt;dbyll code&lt;/a&gt;, I have no idea on how the site works with other OS/browsers. If you find something odd and you're extremely kind, you can e-mail me signalling me the problem. 
&lt;br /&gt;
Edit. I have also created a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/morenomancosu&quot;&gt;Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;, which nowadays seems mandatory for wannabe academics.&lt;/div&gt;
