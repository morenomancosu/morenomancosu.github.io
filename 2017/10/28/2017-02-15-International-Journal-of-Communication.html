Mechanisms that are known to forge political agreement include interpersonal
influence—the process by which people change their ideas according to others’
attitudes—and selection—people’s choice of their discussants according to their
discussants’ preferences. Using data obtained from a longitudinal survey, we test how
these two processes contribute to changing vote choices or discussants around the 2014
European elections in Italy. Results partly confirm findings from the previous literature,
showing influence and selection effects. Moreover, it is suggested that the family
contributes crucially in stimulating strategies that result in political agreement.
Propensities to maintain agreeable discussants over time and to change voting choice
are boosted by exposure to family members.
